# Packaging to Docker image
You can package Jenkinsfile Runner with a specific Jenkins image and turn that into a Docker image.
This way, you can ensure people are running Jenkinsfile in the specific Jenkins environment, for example one that's identical to your production environment.

## Building
Edit the `plugins.txt` to include any plugins you'd like to install. See [the Jenkins Docker README](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker#preinstalling-plugins) for more information.

Then, build the Jenkinsfile Runner image like this:

```
docker build -t jenkinsfile-runner:my-production-jenkins --build-arg JENKINS_VERSION=2.121.1 .
```

If you are rebuilding against latest `lts` image, pass `--no-cache` argument to command above
to avoid using stale layers

The optional `JENKINS_VERSION` specifies the version of Jenkins core.

## Usage
Run the image by providing path to `Jenkinsfile` . For example,

```bash
docker run --rm -v $PWD/test:/workspace jenkinsfile-runner:my-production-jenkins
```

Optionally, if you want to change default parameters for plugins or workspace, you can get onto the container
by overriding entrypoint - binary is placed in `/app/bin/jenkinsfile-runner`

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it -v $PWD/test:/workspace --entrypoint bash jenkinsfile-runner:my-production-jenkins
root@dec4c0f12478:/src# cp -r /app/jenkins /tmp/jenkins
root@dec4c0f12478:/src# /app/bin/jenkinsfile-runner -w /tmp/jenkins -p /usr/share/jenkins/ref/plugins -f /workspace
```

## Debug
In case you want to debug Jenkinsfile Runner, you need to use the "Vanilla" Docker image built following the steps mentioned in the section above.

Then, set the `DEBUG` environment variable and expose the port where to connect the remote debug. Note Jenkinsfile Runner itself
considers 5005 as debugging port but you can map such port to whatever value you prefer through Docker port mapping.

```bash
docker run --rm -e DEBUG=true -p 5005:5005 -v $PWD/test:/workspace jenkinsfile-runner:my-production-jenkins
```

In case you are having issues when the Docker image is generated in another way (for example through [Custom WAR Packager](https://github.com/jenkinsci/custom-war-packager/)),
you can directly pass `JAVA_OPTS` using the Docker run arguments:

```bash
docker run --rm -e JAVA_OPTS='-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005' -p 5005:5005 -v $PWD/test:/workspace jenkinsfile-runner:my-production-jenkins
```
