# Jenkinsfile Runner Architecture overview

This page provides a brief overview of the Jenkinsfile Runner architecture.

There are 6 modules:
  * `app`
  * `bootstrap`
  * `payload`
  * `payload-dependencies`
  * `setup`
  * `tests`

The `demo` folder contains some examples, especially demonstrating the
integration with [Custom WAR Packer](https://github.com/jenkinsci/custom-war-packager/).

## `app` module

Picks what's necessary from other modules by adding them as dependencies and configures
the `appassembler-maven-plugin` so that an assembly is generated, containing the Jenkinsfile Runner as an
executable script.

## `bootstrap` module

Contains special classloader configuration so that Jenkinsfile Runner is able to work both with Jenkins classes and with the
own project classes. It also contains the `Bootstrap` class:
  * The `main()` for the Jenkinsfile Runner application.
  * Configures the execution based on the values of the provided parameters.
  * Launches the execution.

## `payload` module

Contains the configuration for the "real" pipeline job to be configured and run on the ephemeral Jenkins instance. It basically:
  * Creates a Pipeline job configured to optimize performance.
  * Sets the Jenkinsfile to be executed.
  * Sets the specified parameters.
  * (Un)Sets the script security plugin security layer.
  * Schedules a build and wait for the finalisation, redirecting the logs to the system output.

## `payload-dependencies` module

The `payload` module depends on the presence of many other plugins,
but they are only used during the compilation and therefore are not shipped to runtime.

Having all the dependencies under payload-dependencies makes it easier to exclude
them from assembly.

## `setup` module

It implements the `JenkinsfileRunnerLauncher` in charge of starting the Jenkins instance and calling the Jenkinsfile Runner
execution engine, configuring the classloader properly.

It also contains classes to implement or configure this "environment", such as a custom implementation for the Plugin Manager
or a WAR exploder in charge of exploding the WAR file and fully initialising an instance.

## `tests` module

Contains the integration tests powered by the [Jenkinsfile Runner Test Framework](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner-test-framework).
